	<text>Selection to Davis Cup Team
Places Pressure on Ashe
SOUTH ORANGE, N. J.,
Aug. 2 (AP).— Arthur Ashe,
the first Negro ever selected
for the United States Davis
Cup tennis team, conceded
with a big grin today that
“there’s more pressure on me
now” to win the Eastern Grass
Court championships.
“They’ll all be shooting for
me," Ashe said, referring to
the other players, “so I guess
I’ll have to shoot back.”
Ashe, a 20-year-old junior
at UCLA, was named yester
day to the four-man team that
will oppose Mexico in the
American Zone semifinal Davis
Cup match August 16-18 at
Los Angeles.
Picked Off Record
Although ranked 18th among
American men, Ashe’s record
this year prompted his selec
tion, according to W. Harcourt
Woods of Short Hills, N. J.,
chairman of the Davis Cup
committee.

	<text>Arthur Ashe Tennis
Player On Threshold
Of Net Greatness
By Charles J. Livingston
Chicago (ANP) The real
ability of an athlete is measured
in far greater terms than those
shown in his record of achieve
ments. His record provides his ap
praisers with an index of his cap
ability, but other intangibles must
also be taken into account. The
latter deals largely with his po
tential. Moreover, in many cases,
the intangibles provide a better
projected picture as to whether an
athlete is marked for future star
dom.
One athlete whose intangibles
stamp him with the mark of a
champion is Arthur Ashe, a clean
cut, talented youth from Rich
mond, Va., who divides his time
between the classrooms of UCLA
and the steaming tennis courts of
the land. He is succeeding in both.
The first Negro player ever to
win a place on the U.S. Davis Cup
tennis team, Ashe today stand on
the threshold to greatness. One of
these days, perhaps very soon,
Ashe, who is only 20, is going to
win both the U.S. national and
Wimbledon tennis championships.
He is already knocking on the
doors of both.
In the recent Wimbledon cham
pionships, the willowy, hard-play
ing Ashe went all the way to the
semi-finals before losing to Chuck
McKinley of San Antonio, the
eventual champion. Then, after
giving every indication of moving
at least into the finals of the
Eastern Grass Court tennis cham
pionship at Orange, N. J., last
week, he was beaten by third
seeded Gene Scott in the quarter
finals. However, he flashed cham
pionship class in both tournaments,
and his rugged and spectacular
playing had the experts buzzing.
Ashe has all the characteristics
to become the greatest tennis
player in the world. He has speed,
power (one of the best services in
ulariy pleasing to Jenkins, a tan
Canadian who works during the
off season as an apprentice veter
inarian in a poultry plant. He said
he wanted some more shutouts to
bring his earned run average down
to about 2.15. It was 3.67 beifore
the game with Fort Lauderdale.
Jenkins said he prefers a low
earned run average to a 20-game
season.

the amateur ranks) and poise. Off
court, he is quiet and unassuming;
on court, he is an explosive player
who never lets up but who always
manages to keep his composure
He is what the experts call a
“pressure player." His concentra
tion is remarkable. So far, no one,
not even McKinley, has been able
to ruffle Ashe.
Like some other players of his
type, such as Althea Gibson, the
first Negro to win the Wimbledon
and U.S. tennis titles, who feature
the booming service as their chief
offensive weapon, Ashe has a fore
arm weakness. But he is fast over
coming that weakness. Otherwise,
his court game leaves little to be
desired.
Ashe's dogged determination, his
fine sense of timing (he never
rushes the net indiscriminately),
his poise and gameness under fire,
as well as his unique ability to
size up and deal with problems as
they develop, are the qualities that
make him an almost sure bet to
rise to the apex in tennis.
These intangibles, quite apart
from Ashe’s natural ability and his
record of accomplishments, must
have weighed heavily with the sel
ectors who named him to the
Davis Cup team over such higher
ranked stars as Frank Froehling,
and Scott. Foehling is ranked No.
2 nationally; Ashe No. 18. Scott
was seeded seventh in the Eastern
championships.
The U.S. Davis Cup team, con
sisting of McKinley, Ashe, Dennis
Ralston of Bakersfield, Calif., and
Martin Riessen, Hinsdale. 111.,
plays Mexico Aug. 16-18 in Los
Angeles. The matches are to be
played on cement courts, on which
Ashe is a virtual demon. That
factor, too, must have weighed
heavily in Arthur’s favor.</text>
